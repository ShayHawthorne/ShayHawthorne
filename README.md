## Hey, I'm Shay! I'm currently exploring front-end web development and finding my niche.
### So far, I've found that I enjoy...
  - UX/UI, especially the how & why. It's fascinating to me how the smallest changes can have drastic effects on user behavior.
  - Data Analysis & Visualization. Sorting chunks of raw data, seeing the patterns, and displaying findings in a meaningful way is so satisfying.
  - Problem solving & troubleshooting. I find it energizing to noodle through issues in search of possible solutions.
  - Graphic design & editing is something I've always found enjoyable.
  - AI as a tool and the plethora of ways it can be put to use.
  - Programming & scripts. This has been a challenge to me so far but it's a skill I consider important to learn.

### There is not much to show on this lil hub yet but I am working on setting up a website with projects and contact info in the coming weeks ^^
